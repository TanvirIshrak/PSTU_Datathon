Overview
In today's competitive financial services landscape, proactively identifying accounts at risk of instability is essential for client retention and operational efficiency. A leading multinational financial institution has compiled an extensive dataset of anonymized account-level behavioral indicators. Your challenge is to build a robust predictive model that accurately flags accounts likely to become unstable. You are provided with 350 numerical features derived from transaction history, digital engagement, and account metadata — all anonymized to protect client privacy.

Goal
For each account in the test set, predict the probability that the account will be flagged as at-risk (TARGET = 1).

Description
Train Set: Historical account records containing 350 anonymized numerical features and a binary target variable.
Test Set: Account records for which you must submit binary predictions.
Features: feat_1 through feat_350 — pre-processed, anonymized numerical indicators. These features do not carry explicit semantic meaning and have been transformed to preserve confidentiality.
Target: TARGET
0 = Stable Account
1 = At-Risk Account
Problem Statement
Financial institutions handle millions of accounts daily, and early detection of at-risk accounts can significantly reduce churn and improve client satisfaction. However, the underlying signals of account instability are often buried in complex, high-dimensional behavioral data. This competition presents a binary classification problem where participants must leverage 350 anonymized numerical features to predict whether an account will be flagged as unstable. The features capture various aspects of account behavior, including transaction patterns, engagement metrics, and account metadata — all stripped of identifiable information.

Why This Matters
Accurate prediction of account instability allows institutions to:

Intervene early with targeted support programs
Optimize resource allocation for account management teams
Reduce unexpected account closures and associated revenue loss
Data Format
The training data is provided as a CSV file with the following structure:

Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using the ** F1 Score** .

Submission File
For each ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for the TARGET variable. But in the traning set there is no ID column remember that. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

id,TARGET
2,0
5,0
6,0
7,0
etc.
Submitted probabilities will be converted to binary predictions using a threshold of 0.5 before computing the Macro F1 score.
